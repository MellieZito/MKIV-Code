## Getting Libraries
First run the `setup.sh` script to get all the defualt AVR libraries.
```bash
$ sudo bash setup.sh
```

Then you need to add an additional AVR library for the specific MCU we use (ATmega16m1)
```bash
$ bash getDir.sh
```

## Compiling and Flashing Boards
To flash your C code onto an ATmega, you need to compile that code into a certain type that the ATmega can read. Sounds compilcated! Luckily, we have a nice series of scripts that does it all for you!
```bash
$ python3 make.py
```
Then just enter what board you want to flash and select if you want to flash it or just compile it.
If you're flashing the board for the first time make sure to set the fuse bits on the MCU by typing "fuses" when prompted like so:
```bash
$ Flash (y/n) or Set Fuses(fuses):fuses
```
Voila! Happy programming
